# YouTube Clone

This project is a **YouTube homepage clone** that I created using **HTML5** and **CSS3**. The goal was to replicate the layout and styling of YouTube's homepage, focusing on responsiveness and clean design.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to both desktop and mobile screens, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.
- **CSS Styling**: The design closely follows YouTube's official homepage UI, from the navigation bar to the video grid.
- **Structured HTML Layout**: The code is organized for easy navigation and readability, making it simple to modify or extend.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides the foundational structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
